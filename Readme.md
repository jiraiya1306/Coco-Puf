## Introduction

Welcome to the Coco Puf Project! This project aims to predict the output Response for the Cross-Connection Puf using a Binary Classifier Logistic Regression model. By analyzing various features, the model can Predict The correct output of COCO-PUF.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model using Logistic Regression To Predict The Response Generated By C This model helps understand which features are most significant in predicting customer choices and can aid in targeted marketing strategies.

## Model

The model used in this project is a Logistic Regression classifier, which is suitable for binary classification tasks. Logistic Regression predicts the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class (e.g., preference for Coco Pufs).

### Model Pipeline

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
2. **Feature Selection**: Select the most relevant features for prediction.
3. **Model Training**: Train the Logistic Regression model on the training dataset.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
5. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict customer preferences.

### Model Parameters

- **Regularization**: L2 (Ridge) regularization to avoid overfitting.
- **Solver**: ‘liblinear’ for small datasets and binary classification.
- **Threshold**: Decision threshold set to 0.5 for binary classification.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jiraiya1306/Coco-Puf.git
   cd Coco-Puf
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare the dataset**: Ensure that your dataset is in the `data` directory.

2. **Open the given .py file**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Open `submit.py` and run to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.

3. **Make Predictions**:

   Use the provided script to make predictions on new customer data:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --input data/new_customers.csv --output results/predictions.csv
   ```

   **Parameters**:

   - `--input`: Path to the new customer data file.
   - `--output`: Path to save the prediction results.

## Results

### Model Performance

The Logistic Regression model achieved the following performance metrics on the test dataset:

- **Accuracy**: 99.8% for Response1 and 98.8% for Response0

The model shows good performance in predicting the output of PUF.
